My solutions for [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018), written in Clojure.   

Other Clojure solutions are [here](https://github.com/adventofcode-clojurians/adventofcode-clojurians).

## Usage

Each day has its own namespace file under src/, and a corrresponding input data file in resources/.

Run each solution via the Clojure REPL.
